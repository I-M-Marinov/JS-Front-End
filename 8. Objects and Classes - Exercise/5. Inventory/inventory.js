/* 
Create a function, which creates a register for heroes, with their names, level, and items (if they have such). 
The input comes as an array of strings. Each element holds data for a hero, in the following format:

"{heroName} / {heroLevel} / {item1}, {item2}, {item3}..." 

You must store the data about every hero. The name is a string, a level is a number and the items are all strings.
The output is all of the data for all the heroes youâ€™ve stored sorted ascending by level. The data must be in the following format for each hero:

Hero: {heroName}
level => {heroLevel}
Items => {item1}, {item2}, {item3}
