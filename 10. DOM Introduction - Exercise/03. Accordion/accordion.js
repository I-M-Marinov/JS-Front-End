/* 
An HTML file is given and your task is to show more/less information. 
By clicking the [More] button, it should reveal the content of a hidden div and changes the text of the button to [Less]. 
When the same link is clicked again (now reading Less), hide the div and change the text of the link to More.
Link action should be toggleable (you should be able to click the button an infinite amount of times).

*
*************************************************Hints*************************************************
•	To change the text content of a button, you could use getElementsByClassName. 
However, that returns a collection and we need only one element from it, 
so the correct way is to use getElementsByClassName("button")[0] as it will return the needed span element.

•	After that, we should change the display style of the div with an id "extra". 
If the display style is "none", we should change it to "block" and the opposite.

•	Along with all of this, we should change the text content of the button to [Less]/[More].

function toggle() {

    const buttonElement = document.getElementsByClassName("button")[0];
    const extraTextElement = document.getElementById("extra");

    if ( buttonElement.textContent == "Less"){
        extraTextElement.style.display = 'none';
        buttonElement.textContent = "More";
    } else {
        extraTextElement.style.display = 'block';
        buttonElement.textContent = "Less";
    }
    
        console.log(buttonElement.textContent);
        console.log(extraTextElement);
